## Lab 8
1. I've gotten the map and all markers to render. The only performance optimization that I did not succeed with was moving the JavaScript includes and code to the bottom of the HTML file before the closing body tag.
2. I posted in Piazza, but other than that have not collaborated with anyone.
3. I have spent approximately 5 hours on this lab.
4. Performance Enhancements

**Before any performance optimizations were made:**
<p>DOMContentLoaded: 210 ms<br>
Load: 621 ms<br>
localhost size: 791 B<br>
style.css size: 305 B<br>
index.js size: 1.4 kB</p>

**After performance optimizations:**
<p>DOMContentLoaded: 279 ms<br>
Load: 622 ms<br>
localhost size: 799 B<br>
style.css size: 251 B<br>
minifiedindex.js size: 1.1 kB</p>

<p>The only recommended performance optimization that I did not succeed with was moving the JavaScript includes and code to the bottom of the HTML file before the closing body tag.
Other than that, it is clear that the optimizations made with the css file and js file both helped to reduce file size. the css file reduced by 54 B and the js file reduced by .3 kB.</p>

## Lab 10
1. So far, I have determined and marked my location on the map.
2. I have not collaborated with anyone on this lab.
3. I have spent about 6 hours on this lab.
